<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  This project is part of my beginner web development course, where I am learning the fundamentals of HTML. 
  The task focuses on understanding how to structure a webpage using different HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. 
  It allows me to practice writing clean and organized code while following best practices for web development.

  Through this task, I am gaining hands-on experience in building a simple web page from scratch. 
    It helps me understand the importance of semantic HTML and how to create content that is both accessible and easy to read. 
    Additionally, I am learning how to properly format text and include essential elements that enhance the user experience.

  Completing this task is an important step in my journey to becoming a web developer. 
  By applying what I have learned in the course, I am building a strong foundation that will help me progress to more advanced topics such as CSS and JavaScript. 
  I am excited to continue improving my skills and exploring new aspects of web development.
